The idea of foraging—finding wild, edible plants—can sound intimidating, like something out of a survivalist show. But the truth is, a surprising amount of delicious and nutritious food is hiding in plain sight, right in your own backyard or local park. Learning to forage is a rewarding skill that connects you with nature and can add some unique flavors to your cooking.

Before you start, a crucial rule: **Never eat anything unless you are 100% sure of its identification.** Many plants have poisonous look-alikes. Start with common, easy-to-identify plants that have no dangerous counterparts. A great place to begin is with dandelions. Every part of this familiar yellow flower is edible. The leaves are great in salads, the petals can be used as a garnish, and the roots can be roasted and ground into a coffee substitute.

Another beginner-friendly plant is wild garlic (also known as ramsons or wild leeks). Its long, green leaves have a distinct garlic or onion smell and flavor. You can often find it growing in patches in damp, shady woodlands. Just be sure to crush a leaf and smell it—if it doesn’t smell like garlic, don’t eat it.

Other good starting points include wild berries like blackberries and mulberries, which are hard to mistake. Just be mindful of where you pick—avoid areas near roads or industrial sites where plants might have absorbed pollutants. Also, always remember to forage sustainably by only taking what you need and leaving plenty for the animals and for the plant to continue growing. Learning to forage isn't just about finding food; it's about learning to observe the world around you and appreciate the bounty of nature.
